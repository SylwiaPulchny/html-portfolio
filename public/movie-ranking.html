<hr />

<h3>Solo Leveling</h3>
<p>I like this movie because it shows that completing different daily quests leads to becoming one of the strongest in the game.</p>

<h3>Dead Note</h3>
<p>I like the fact that the main character is trying to elimiate criminals.</p>

<h3>Tokyo-Ghul</h3>
<p>I have watched it recetly and liked the first two seasons. Seson three was focusing more on teamfights and I've lost the track of the movie.</p>
