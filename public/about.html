<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Sylwia and I live in London, UK. I have staarted programming only yesterday. 
  It is a new hobby so I am looking forward to learning new things about it.</p>

<p>So far, I have learnt how to make paragraphs and void elements. I have done a movie rankings, listed elements, learnt about nesting and indeting, anchor elements, image elements. 
  I have also done birthday invite project and filed paths. 
  I am now trying to use the HTML Boilerplate and  its time to build a portfolio project.</p>

<p>I know that it will take some time to get a grasp with everything, but so far is exiciting so I am hoping it is going to be a fun time. Wish me luck.</p>
